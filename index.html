<h2>Time</h2>
<p>2009 is the time that most of the story takes place, during the age known as the “Great Reconstruction”- when i5 chips were “reformed” and the Intel Core i7 chips started coming out.</p>
<h2>Place</h2>
<p>The “motherboard” is the place in which most of the story takes place (since this is where most of the electrical components are housed), however there is a rumor of “the world outside of the shell”- one in which no component has ever visited (or survived to tell of it) and is not physically but instead mentally explored occasionally in the story.</p>
<h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
<p>In the digital society that each of the electrical components on a computer’s motherboard is a part of, the distinct way of operating known as “tech culture” has arisen. To fully cooperate with this cultural mindset, each of the components follow exactly what they are instructed to do (by Central since he is the CPU) in a respectful manner and never object to what they are told. Although “tech culture” has a polytheistic religion associated with it -due to the fact that each component believes that they were formed using a different machine, such as microprocessors believing that their creators were “the light” (photolithography)- each of the components live in unity with one another and act as an efficient unit.

<h1 id="plot">Plot</h1>
<div id="plot1" class="plot">
<h2>Conflict: Man vs. Self and Man vs. Technology</h2>
<p>Although the conflict type should truly be “component vs. self”, etc. the concepts “man vs. self” and “man vs. technology” capture the conflicts that the main character, Central, feels throughout his processor's journey. In the context of “man vs. self”, Central has the internal conflict of feeling as though he is not efficient, fast, or advanced enough, so he sometimes overheats due to this frustration, however he also uses this frustration as a motivation to constantly improve himself to meet the needs of his user. Relating to “man vs. technology”, or rather “man vs. new technology”, Central has the external conflict of constantly being in competition with the new Intel Core i7 chip that threatens his survival throughout the book by boasting of its performance (through online ads).</p>
</div>
<div id="plot2" class="plot">
<h2>Exposition</h2>
<ul class="att">
<li>Central is introduced in a stereotypical way, highlighting his demanding aspect in relation to the operation of the other components (since he sends them commands digitally).</li>
<li>Cool is introduced as a character who is constantly running to make sure that Central is operating to the best of his ability.</li>
<li>PB (the power button) is introduced as a slightly mysterious character who constantly tries to make sure that he is operating as instructed by Central (but his mysteriousness in the beginning serves as a foreshadow to his true self later on in the story).</li>
<li>EPC (the external power control) is introduced as a character who serves as the mediator for the tension that Central feels and provides him with positive energy (electrical current) to serve as though he is constantly supporting his efforts.</li>
<li>GC (the graphics card) is introduced as one who is respectful of the decisions made by those “higher up” than him.</li>
<li>The time period (2009 in the US) is introduced along with the place being the motherboard and “the world outside of the shell”.</li>
<li>The internal and external conflicts are introduced: Central always feels as though he is not enough and his performance is something that his fellow components should look down upon (although he is extremely underestimated). Since he is constantly pressured to make decisions that he feels will ensure the confidence of his user (so that he and the rest of the computer will not be scrapped to buy a new one with an Intel i7 chip), he sometimes carries this frustration towards his external conflict out in a negative way (such as overheating), but strives to improve himself and uses this as a source for determination..</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="plot3" class="plot">
<h2>Inciting Incident</h2>
<p>On a usual runtime schedule during a particular day in 2009, his user navigated to a technology website that he frequently went to, checking on the latest updates in technology and newest breakthroughs. Without warning before the event occurred, an advertisement for a new CPU chip developed by Intel appeared on the screen- a notice that the Intel Core i7 was soon coming out, with specs that massively outperformed the now-outdated Intel i5 chip. Since this spontaneously appeared on the computer’s screen, Central did not have time to instruct his digital handler, GC (the graphics card), to block it before the user saw it, and thus the seeds of his definite destruction were planted. There was no escaping his user’s now constant want for more performance out of his i5 processor, but could he perform to an even higher level than he was currently executing? This will be revealed as the story progresses.</p>

<div id="plot4" class="plot">
<h2>Rising Action</h2>
<ol class="att" id="action" style="text-align:left;">
<li>Central performs his duties as normal but panics when he sees his user navigating to more websites related to the new Intel Core i7 chip, so to solve this, he instructs his Internet subprocessor to block all sites related to this product. As a consequence of this, his efficiency his undermined and his user starts to have a growing concern for the operation of his current CPU.</li>
<li>Out of fear of his user’s reaction in response to his unusually slow lag time when starting the computer, Central allocated more power to his fellow components (in an attempt to make the computer run faster), but without proper training, he instead caused a larger issue that led to an even greater lack of processing power in the computer as a whole, further undermining his user’s confidence.</li>
<li>Determined to improve his performance and power distribution abilities (to boost his efficiency), he trained until he performed considerably better than he had ever done before, but with his user still motivated to buy a new computer containing the i7 chip, unrealistic expectations were put in place for Central to meet.</li>
<li>Noticing his user to be unusually annoyed with his computer’s performance (due to the keylogging capabilities that he received data from), Central performed at the fastest speed that he had ever executed at previously due to the efficiency tactics that he had trained so hard on in the past few days, but not noticing the extreme temperature that he generated because of this, not even Cool could keep up with the temperature that he emitted. A few moments later, Central burned out and seemed as though his damage was beyond repair.</li>
<li>Noticing the almost irreparable damage that Central suffered, Cool almost burned out herself attempting to save the component that ensured their survival (with the help of EPC), however due to the unwillingness of PB to help (since he secretly wished that he was reformed into a more useful component rather than just a simplistic power button), the computer’s operations were suspended for quite some time. After a while of convincing PB to help with the cause since he was one of the most important components of the entire computer after all, Cool and the rest of the components pushed their own personal limits to “revive” Central through their own special tactics.</li>

</div>
<div id="plot5" class="plot">
<h2>Climax</h2>
<p>Although attempting to save Central took the unity of all of the components to act for a specific cause (which was seemingly hard to do since Central was not there to control them) in addition to severely exhausting them, Central slowly came back to a more stable state and survived this terrible peril.</p>

</div>
<div id="plot6" class="plot">
<h2>Falling Action</h2>
<ol class="att" id="action" style="text-align:left;">
<li>Even though Central had proved to burn out once before, the resilience that the computer demonstrated to continue on and restabilize from the most trying circumstances caused their user to ultimately keep the computer, shown through the joy that he experienced via similar keylogging techniques that were used before.</li>
<li>With the confidence of their user fully secured, Central celebrated via sending more power to each of the components so that they could “feel good” for a limited amount of time, a form of partying as legalized by tech culture.</li>
<li>Since it was the temperature regulating power of Cool that ultimately kept him alive, Central and her formed a long lasting relationship that resulted in a “love affair” later down the line.</li>

<h2>Resolution</h2>
<p>With the conflict over and all of their problems seemingly resolved, eight years later, their user was still very satisfied with the performance that they delivered. However, the next dreaded event occurred. An advertisement for the new Intel Core i9 processor appeared on their user’s screen. Could this truly be the end?</p>

<h1 id="wrsa">Writing Sample</h1>
<h2>Setting</h2>
<ul class="att">
<li>“A familiar hum could be heard in the air, a whoosh of wind, then a suddenly hot blast of air [...]”</li>
<li>“[...] a maze of electrical components strewn alongside, all composed of a metallic substance known as solder.”</li>
<li>“With the air temperature increasing inside to a disastrous degree, [...] other problems started to arise.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Indirect Characterization</h2>
<ul class="att">
<li>In the line “GC, shift pixels 1024 through 2027 to the color red. The user must have a responsive output!”, Central demonstrates that he is very demanding over all operations that occur on the Motherboard, due to his use of diction such as “shift” and “must”, along with not giving other components a choice to decide.</li>
<li>Later in the writing sample, the line “I know that I have been running slower than normal lately, but could this be the end?” demonstrates that Central is very concerned with how he is perceived by society (and especially his user), and is thus very insecure due to this hindrance.</li>
<li>Through the way that the user of the computer is presented throughout the story, using keywords such as “The User” and “Him”, it can also be shown that each of the components (especially Central) highly exalt that whom they serve in their processes, and therefore all demonstrate respect towards their master out of fear of what he could do to them.</li>
